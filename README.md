<div style="text-align: justify;">
Hello! I'm Kayque Allan, a dedicated student of Software Engineering at PUC Minas with a passion for technology. Fascinated by the world of computing from an early age, I'm constantly seeking knowledge and improvement in programming. As a Software Engineering student, I'm immersed in a dynamic environment where I apply theoretical concepts to practical projects, always eager to learn and grow through courses, workshops, and hackathons. Beyond programming, I'm also an enthusiast of design, exploring the intersection between aesthetics and functionality in digital products. Committed to personal and professional development, I'm learning English and Spanish to broaden my communication and collaboration opportunities in a globalized world. Here on GitHub, I'm excited to share my projects, collaborate with fellow developers, and contribute to the thriving technology community. Let's innovate and create together for the digital future! </div>
